## Martian Rover Coding Challenge

**Getting Started**

Run these commands to setup the project for development on your machine:

`git clone https://github.com/bradenhs/martian-rover.git`

`cd martian-rover`

`yarn install` or `npm install`

`yarn start` or `npm start`

This should open a browser and start the project in live-reload mode.

**Tests**

Run the automated test suite with:

`yarn test` or `npm test`

**Future Work**

I spent around 4 hours on this project. If I were to give it some more time these are some items I
might take a look at:

- Fill out the test suite. Right now just a few tests were implemented and the code coverage is
fairly low.
- Work on displaying more helpful errors.
- Think about renaming certain objects like `InstructionSet` or `Robot` to make exactly what they
are a little more clear.
